PirateQuesting is a Firefox add-on for the online role-playing game Pirate Quest.

The 1.x series of the extension lived solely in the sidebar and was grossly inefficient. Difficult to maintain and improve, the 1.x code base was essentially scrapped as the 2.0 series was developed.

The 2.0 series relies heavily on the various features of the system being modular and being independent of the sidebar.

The module loading system has been stable for some time but is not frozen and is likely to change soon as the options dialog will include the ability to enable/disable modules.

The sidebar does not yet have all of the features previously available in the 1.x series, however it introduces some new features and, more importantly, is much more extensible.
