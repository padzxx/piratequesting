#summary Project Title

= Introduction =

PirateQuesting derives its name from the online role-playing game Pirate Quest for which it was developed.


= Details =

PirateQuesting first began in January 2008 as an aid to some simple common game actions. It was approved of by [FinalMotive Final Motive] staff prior to significant development. From that it grew into a massive system with remarkably low cohesion and simply astounding levels of coupling. Furthermore, it relied on significant amounts of regex and DOM tree navigation which, unfortunately, was prone to fail whenever [FinalMotive Final Motive] changed something.

Starting at the end of December 2008, PirateQuesting 2 was born. The system is radically different and is, thankfully, more extensible and more maintainable. 

More to come on the 2.0 series in the days ahead.
