<h1>PirateQuesting</h1>
<h3>Version: 2.1b1</h3>
<p>This is a beta! It will have bugs and it will quite possibly annoy you. It is also, however, the only option as the last version is crashing/freezing Firefox.</p>
<p>Features of this release include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Drag and Drop Tabs</li>
	<li>New code for almost every part of the extension</li>
	<li>Not just a sidebar! The extension continues to work while the sidebar is closed.</li>
	<li>Updated fight and training logging. Although they look similar now, the data being collected is much more extensive than the old versions and have more room for growth in ways to display/report the data.</li>
	<li>and much more.</li>
</ul>
