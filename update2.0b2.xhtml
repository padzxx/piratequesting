<h1>PirateQuesting</h1>
<h3>Version: 2.0b2</h3>
<p>This is a beta! It will have bugs and it will quite possibly annoy you. It is also, however, the only option as the last version is crashing/freezing Firefox.</p>
<p>Changes from beta 1</p>
<ul>
	<li>changes the loadOverlay observer to reveal the sidebar content  even in the event of a failure
</li><li>refactored the ProcessResponse to remove the text-to-document conversion and make that a separate function, thus allowing for more specialized uses (in this case, processing prices from the item market)
</li><li>fixes TrainingLog and FightLogViewer/FightLog so the update button/command works as expected
</li><li>Changed the event that's fired when only updating points.
</li><li>Inventory now only updates the points if that's the only part that changed.
</li><li>Equipment no longer requests the item guide when there's missing info for anything other than equipment
</li><li>Fixed Player info processing so stats over 1000 are processed correctly (failed to process correctly when there were commas)</li>
</ul>
